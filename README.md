# Pytorch for Aarch64 Linux
Deep learning inference SW framework based on Pytorch for Aarch64 Linux

In order to run Deep learning application on Aarch64 Linux system (non-Android), I built Pytorch for such system.
It is based on **torch==1.11.0a0+gitunknown**.

I made onboard versions.
Onboard version contains python3.7, python library as well as pytorch in order to build deep learning applications on board.

For instruction, read README.md in each directory.

It was tested on Qualcomm SA8195 platform which works on AGL (Automotive Grade Linux).

## Download python3.7 & python library

./download_file.sh
